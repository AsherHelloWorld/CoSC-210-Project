## Team Name:
* Team member 1: Asher Nathan
* Team member 2: Quinn Handy

## Project proposal:
### <ins> Weekly Planner </ins>
This application will allow users to keep track of what we need to do that week, by showing the user all 7 days, and the events on those given days. It will consist of "Event Objects" or something equivalent to this, and be able to have an arbitrary number of these objects inside. We will use the planner ourselves, and offer it to other people if they are interested.


### USER STORIES FOR ASHER
* As a user, I want to be able to add an event to my weekly plan so that I can keep track of my week. \
* As a user, I want to be able to set a time/date for that event to help avoid overlaps. \
* As a user, I want to be able to delete an event, so that I can change my plans. \
* As a user, I want to be able to clear my entire week, so that when a new week starts, I can . \
* As a user, I want to be able to label a task "permanent," so that it will perservere through a week clear (such as a class that I have every week).
