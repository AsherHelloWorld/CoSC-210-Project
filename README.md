## Team Name:
* Team member 1: **Asher Nathan**
* Team member 2: **Quinn Handy**

## Project proposal:
### <ins> Weekly Planner </ins>
This application will allow users to keep track of what we need to do that week, by showing the user all 7 days, and the events on those given days. It will consist of "Event Objects" or something equivalent to this, and be able to have an arbitrary number of these objects inside. We will use the planner ourselves, and offer it to other people if they are interested.


### USER STORIES FOR *ASHER*
* As a user, I want to be able to add an event to my weekly plan so that I can keep track of my week. 
* As a user, I want to be able to see all my current tasks, so that I can get a sense of how my week looks. 
* As a user, I want to be able to set a time/date for that event to help avoid overlaps. 
* As a user, I want to be able to delete an event, so that I can change my plans. 
* As a user, I want to be able to clear my entire week, so that when a new week starts, I can start fresh. 
* As a user, I want to be able to label a task "permanent," so that it will perservere through a week clear (such as a class that I have every week).

### USER STORIES FOR *QUINN*
* As a user, I want to be able to change the time/date of events so I can adjust if things change. 
* As a user, I want to add notes to events so I can prepare for what's happening. 
* As a user, I want to add a location to events so I can know where it is. 
* As a user, I want to be able to view all the events I have in a given day so that I can be ready for the day.
